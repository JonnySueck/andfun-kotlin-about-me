    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Jonny.
\n\nI love Llamas.
\n\nThe kind that is alive and jumps around in an amazon or valley, or at a petting zoo, and definitely the mountains.
\nFun fact is that I have several llamas i keep in a small box.
\n\nI like eating llama, too. Raw llama. Grilled llama. Smoked llama. Poached llama - not so much.
\nAnd sometimes I even go llama tipping.
\nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch one.
\n\nOnce, when I was camping in Peru, and very hungry, I even caught a large llama with my hands.
\n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own box o\' llamas.
\nYou should ask someone else about llama hunting, though.\n\n</string>
